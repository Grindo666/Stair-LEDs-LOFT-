This is the build guide for the project. 
It features a parts list and instructions on how to assemble the project.
For now, the current version will focus only on the vero/strip board version as that's the only one I've built so far.
As I build and improve the the PCBs, I will update the build guide with PCB specific info. 


Parts List;

This project will require the following components:

- ESP32 WROOM dev board
- USB plug and cable to power ESP32
- RGB LED strip, non-addressable, w/power supply
- 3x 10k resistor
- 3x 220R resistor
- 3x MOSFET IRFZ44N
- 30 x female pcb socket
- 2x 3-way Molex connectors and pin headers
- 1x 4-way Molex connector and pin headers
- 10x crimpable wire pin terminals
- 1x 2.1mm DC power socket
- Wire 


It will also require the following tools:

- Soldering iron and solder
- Wire strippers
- Wire cutters
- Crimping tool
- Desoldering tool (optional)
- Magnifier (optional)
- Breadboard (optional) - use to prototype the circuiit before committing to PCB if you're not feeling brave ;-)
